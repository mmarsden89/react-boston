      'React & GraphQL - Bringing Simplicity and Correctness to Client Side Development',
    speaker: 'Chris Toomey',
    description: `One of React‚Äôs stronger attributes is the component model which allows us to combine behavior and presentation of functional units as opposed to along the arbitrary technology focused separation previously used, but unfortunately had less to say about data needs. With GraphQL we can have an ideal final slide to allow our components to fully encapsulate all of their requirements while keeping things modular and reusable. In this talk we‚Äôll cover both the theory and practice of client development with React and GraphQL, along the way highlighting the areas where we can even more strongly leverage its power and flexibility.`

    speaker: 'Vincent Riemer',
    description: `You don‚Äôt go building something like React Native DOM without anticipating a few bruises along the way. Most of its development was a loop of hitting roadblocks and finding ‚Äúcreative‚Äù solutions around them. In this talk I‚Äôll highlight some of of the largest roadblocks faced in React Native DOM‚Äôs development and the (occasionally absurd) solutions it took to overcome them such as Image‚Äôs tintColor prop, layout animations, the back handler, and more.`

As well as how we tackled component documentation that stays up to date with API changes. Lastly, we will explore new ideas that we will want to explore like working with AirBnb's react-sketchapp.`

In today‚Äôs online world, online criticism can be misinterpreted easily.

    speaker: 'Artem Sapegin',
    description: `Custom CSS is the simplest way to make the UI inconsistent, especially if we‚Äôre talking about spacing between UI elements, font sizes or colors. When developers have too much freedom in defining the UI, they will do things differently. The issue could be solved by avoiding any custom CSS on the app level and having a set of primitive components that allow developers to glue UI together in a consistent way.`

The way these technologies combine allow the creation of performant, powerful web applications with impressive time-to-interactive metrics.`

For example, at Khan Academy, we fill the user‚Äôs screen with confetti rain when they get 100% correct on an exercise. I‚Äôll talk about how we drew on 2D physics to make the confetti feel real. Make no mistake; while this talk straddles the line between engineering and UX design, this is very much a React talk. We'll look at how to abstract motion and whimsical behavior into reusable components, how to fold up the DOM like origami, and how to do SVG/canvas animation in a React-friendly way.`

This talk will explain all the problems I had and solutions that I used to port my native app written in C++, to a full React + WebAssembly app - while still keeping all existing features! Spoiler alert: At the end, it works.`

Leaning on automation helps, but how do you automate code changes?  In this talk, Francois goes over the various parsers and code transformation tools such as Babel, TypeScript, Recast and jscodeshift, where they fit in the ecosystem, and how to use them to automate code changes across hundreds of projects to keep your React (or any other) apps in sync with the rest of the world. Attendees will learn about the various ways to work with JavaScript ASTs (there's a lot!) as well as how to orchestrate migrations and pull requests when manual no longer works.`
